    <h1>Moulay Idriss zerhoun, the birthplace of a dynasty</h1>
    <p>
      Moulay Driss Zerhoun, often referred to simply as Moulay Idriss, is a town located in northern Morocco. It is of great historical and religious significance, as it was founded by Moulay Idriss I, who was the great-grandson of Prophet Muhammad. Moulay Idriss I is considered the founder of the Idrisid dynasty, which ruled over parts of North Africa from the 8th to the 10th centuries.

    The town's traditional architecture, narrow streets, and vibrant marketplaces add to its charm. Visitors can explore the local culture, enjoy traditional Moroccan cuisine, and experience the warm hospitality of the local population.

Due to its close proximity to the Roman ruins of Volubilis, a UNESCO World Heritage site, many tourists combine visits to both Moulay Idriss and Volubilis, making it a popular destination for history enthusiasts and travelers interested in exploring Morocco's rich past.</p1>
